# 🧩 HTML Modules Tasks 
🎯 Task Description
You’ll be given a reference image (a simple web page). Your mission is to write HTML code that reproduces the layout and content to look the same as the image. Focus on structure, hierarchy, and semantic tags. 🧠💻

# 🎯 Objectives
Practice choosing the right HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, etc.).

Build a clean, semantic document structure.

Understand how inline vs block elements affect layout.

# 📦 What You’ll Get
A PNG/JPG mockup image of a simple page (hero title, subtitle, paragraph, image/logo, button-like link, simple list, and a footer line). 🖼️

# 🛠️ What You Should Do
Analyze the image: identify sections (header, main, footer). 🔍

Build the skeleton using proper tags: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>.

Use semantic elements where appropriate: <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer>.

Add content with the correct tags:

Headings: <h1>–<h3>

Text: <p>

Links/Buttons: <a> (styled as a button later in CSS, for now just a link)

Lists: <ul> / <ol> + <li>

Images: <img alt="...">

Lines/dividers: <hr> if shown in the mockup

Keep your HTML valid, clean, and readable (indentation matters!). ✨


# 📤 Submission
File name: replica.html

Include any images you used (or use a placeholder URL).

Optional: add a short comment at the top explaining which tags you chose and why. 💬

# 🧪 Evaluation (Rubric)
Semantic Structure (40%) – Appropriate use of headings, sections, lists, and links.

Accuracy (30%) – Content order and hierarchy resemble the image.

Accessibility (15%) – Proper alt text, meaningful link text, logical heading order.

Code Quality (15%) – Clean indentation, valid HTML, helpful comments.

# 💡 Tips & Hints
Use heading levels to match visual importance from the image.

Buttons in the image? Use an <a> for now (we’ll style it later). 🔘

If you see grouped content, consider <section> or <article>.

Remember: block elements stack; inline elements flow within a line. 📚
