# Task 5: Book Catalog API Integration & CRUD Operations

## Modules Covered
8, 9, 10 (optional)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Fetch book data from Firebase using Axios, display it as a catalog grid, and implement Add, Edit, and Soft Delete operations.

---

## Steps

1. **Store at least 25 books in your Firebase database.**

2. **Create a `BookCatalog` component** that:
   - Fetches books from Firebase using Axios.
   - Displays books in a grid layout.

3. **Implement Add Book functionality:**
   - A form to add new books.
   - On submission, add the book to Firebase.
   - Update the catalog view immediately.

4. **Implement Edit Book functionality:**
   - Allow editing book details.
   - Save changes to Firebase.

5. **Implement Soft Delete:**
   - Instead of deleting books permanently, mark them as deleted (e.g., add a `deleted: true` field).
   - Filter out soft-deleted books from display.

6. **Use Axios for all HTTP requests to Firebase.**
