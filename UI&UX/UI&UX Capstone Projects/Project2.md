# üé® Website & Mobile App Design (Mockup & Wireframe)

---

## üìù Short Brief

This project involves designing a **front-end website** and a **mobile app** for a concept of your choice. Students will create both low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity mockups using tools like **Figma**, **Adobe XD**, or similar front-end design software. The purpose is to demonstrate a strong understanding of UI/UX principles, responsive design, visual hierarchy, and consistent style guide application.

## üß∞ Tech Competencies Acquired

By completing this project, students will be able to:

- Design and differentiate between **low-fidelity wireframes** and **high-fidelity mockups**.
- Create designs for both **desktop** and **mobile** layouts.
- Apply a **consistent style guide** across multiple screens.
- Use industry-standard tools like **Figma** or **Adobe XD** for collaborative prototyping.
- Structure layouts using **grids and spacing systems**.
- Plan responsive layouts for multiple device sizes.
- Document and present UI/UX design work effectively.

## üåç Project Context

Imagine you are a **junior UI/UX designer** working for a client who needs a **website and mobile app**.

The client has given you complete freedom to choose the project idea (e.g., e-commerce store, travel booking app, learning platform, portfolio website, etc.), but requires:

- Clear and intuitive navigation
- A polished and consistent look
- Both web and mobile views
- A documented style guide

You must design **wireframes** and **mockups** for the main screens of your chosen project.
