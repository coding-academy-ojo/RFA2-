# CSS Task: Discover the Position Property

## Description
In this task, you will watch a short video showing a basic website layout where boxes are arranged using CSS **position** properties. Your goal is to carefully observe the layout and identify which `position` values were applied to achieve the effect.

**Hint:** Think about the different `position` values in CSS:
- `static`
- `relative`
- `absolute`
- `fixed`
- `sticky`
