# üîê Registration & Login UI/UX Design (Mockup & Wireframe)

---

## üìù Short Brief

This project focuses on designing a **modern, user-friendly registration and login interface** for a web or mobile application.

Students will create **low-fidelity wireframes** and **high-fidelity mockups** in Figma to showcase their understanding of form design, visual hierarchy, accessibility, and responsive layouts.

The design should be intuitive, visually appealing, and guide the user smoothly from **account creation** to **successful login**.
