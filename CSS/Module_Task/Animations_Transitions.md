# CSS Task: Battery Reload Animation

## Description

### Instructions:
1. **Create the Battery Shape**
   - Use HTML and CSS to create a simple battery container and inner fill element.
   - Style it so it visually resembles a battery.

2. **Add Animation**
   - Use CSS animations or transitions to:
     - Gradually fill the battery from 0% to 100%.
