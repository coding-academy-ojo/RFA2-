### **📛 Title**

# EduTrack - A Student Progress Tracking - SaaS Application

---

### **📝 Short Brief**

EduTrack is a browser-based **Software as a Service (SaaS)** platform that allows instructors, tutors, and training centers to track students’ learning progress, record grades, provide feedback, and generate progress reports — all online.

The app will simulate a multi-user environment, where each instructor can manage their class data securely in the browser.

---

### **🛠 Tech Competencies Acquired**

By completing this project, learners will gain:

- **JavaScript Mastery** – DOM manipulation, ES6+ syntax, event handling, and modular code.
- **Data Structures** – Arrays, objects, and nested data for storing student records.
- **State Persistence** – Using `localStorage` or IndexedDB to store user-specific data.
- **API Simulation** – Mock or real API calls for fetching and storing progress reports.
- **Dynamic UI** – Generating and updating student tables and charts in real time.
- **Authentication Logic** – Basic sign-in/sign-out simulation for multiple instructors.
- **SaaS Thinking** – Designing features to serve multiple users with isolated data.

---

### **🌍 Project Context**

Modern education is shifting towards **cloud-based learning platforms**, and instructors need **real-time, accessible tools** to track performance.

EduTrack will mimic this environment, giving students a taste of building a **multi-user SaaS** while solving a real-world problem.

The app will:

- Let instructors **log in** and see their own dashboard.
- Add, edit, and delete student records.
- Track assignments, quizzes, and exam scores.
- Auto-generate visual charts for performance analytics.

---

### **📋 Project Requirements**

The application must include:

1. **Instructor Login (Simulated)**
    - Each instructor logs in with their name/email.
    - Only their own students’ data appears.
2. **Student Management**
    - Add a new student with name, ID, and enrolled courses.
    - Update student scores and attendance records.
    - Delete or archive student profiles.
3. **Progress Reports**
    - Calculate total grades automatically.
    - Display analytics with charts (e.g., grade distribution).
4. **Data Persistence**
    - Store instructor and student data in `localStorage`.
5. **Responsive Layout**
    - Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

---

### **📊 Performance Criteria**

The project will be assessed on:

- **Functionality** – All listed features work without errors.
- **Code Quality** – ES6+ features, modular functions, clear variable naming.
- **UI/UX** – Easy to navigate, clean visuals, responsive design.
- **SaaS Simulation** – Correctly isolates each instructor’s data.
- **Innovation** – Extra features like export to CSV, student search, or notifications.

---

### **🧪 Assessment Methods**

- **Live Demo** – Walkthrough from login to report generation.
- **Code Review** – Instructors review and evaluate logic, structure, and readability.
- **Peer Testing** – Other students test and give feedback on usability.

## 🧭 Assessment Overview

Assessors should evaluate EduTrack for correctness, clarity, educational value, and production readiness within the scope of a client-side SaaS MVP. Total points = **100**.

## 🧾 Rubric (Each row scored 1–4)

| Criterion (weight %) | Excellent (4) | Good (3) | Fair (2) | Poor (1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Functionality (25%)** | All required features implemented and work reliably (login simulation, add/edit/delete students, score calc, analytics). | Most major features implemented; small bugs. | Core features exist but broken in places. | Many missing features or non-working functionality. |
| **Data Isolation & Persistence (15%)** | Instructor data is fully isolated; localStorage schema stable; save/load works flawlessly. | Data mostly isolated; minor persistence edge cases. | Data mixes between users; persistence flaky. | No proper persistence or user isolation. |
| **Analytics & Reports (10%)** | Accurate grade calculations + clear charts/reports; export feature works. | Reports mostly accurate; minor UI issues. | Reports exist but inaccurate or limited. | No analytics or broken reporting. |
| **Code Quality & Structure (15%)** | Modular, ES6+, well commented, reusable functions, sensible file structure. | Mostly modular; some code smell or missing comments. | Monolithic files; poor naming; few comments. | Hard to read, unmaintainable code. |
| **UI/UX & Responsiveness (10%)** | Clean, accessible UI; mobile-first and keyboard friendly. | Good layout; some responsiveness issues. | Barely responsive; usability problems. | Non-responsive, cluttered UI. |
| **SaaS Simulation & Multi-User Logic (8%)** | Login flow properly simulates different instructors; data scoped per user. | Works for basic flows but some edge cases. | Login simulation exists but data not fully scoped. | No user separation or broken flows. |
| **Error Handling & Validation (7%)** | Strong validation, graceful error messages, and input sanitization. | Basic validation present; some missing cases. | Minimal validation; visible JS errors. | No validation; crashes or silent failures. |
| **Documentation & Deliverables (5%)** | Complete README, setup, screenshots, API notes, and demo video. | README present; missing some details. | Minimal README, no screenshots. | No documentation. |
| **Innovation / Bonus Features (5%)** | Extra features (CSV export, filters, history) well-implemented. | One or two extras implemented. | Attempted extras but incomplete. | No extras. |

## ⚖️ Grading Scheme & Passing Thresholds

- Max score = **100**.
- Passing threshold = **70 / 100**.
- Grade bands:
    - **85–100** = Excellent (A)
    - **70–84** = Satisfactory (B)
    - **50–69** = Needs Improvement (C) — remediation required
    - **<50** = Fail (D/F) — major rework required

Weights from rubric above apply to compute final numeric grade.

## ✅ Detailed Assessment Method (Trainer Guide)

**Preparation (before student demo)**

1. Clone student repo; follow README to open `index.html` or run dev server.
2. Run quick smoke test: create one instructor, add two students, add scores, view report.

**Functional Checklist (use during demo)**

- [ ]  Instructor login simulation: create/login multiple instructors → data isolation.
- [ ]  Add/Edit/Delete student profile (name, ID, courses).
- [ ]  Enter scores for assignments, quizzes, compute total grade.
- [ ]  Generate per-student and class-level analytics (chart renders).
- [ ]  Export report (CSV/PDF) if implemented.
- [ ]  Persistence: reload page and confirm data persists.
- [ ]  Edge cases: empty inputs, invalid score entry, duplicate student ID.

**Code Review Checklist**

- [ ]  Files organized (e.g., `index.html`, `styles/`, `scripts/`, modules).
- [ ]  Use of ES6 features (let/const, arrow funcs, modules) where appropriate.
- [ ]  Comments & inline explanations for complex logic.
- [ ]  Separation of concerns (storage logic separated from UI).
- [ ]  No large duplicated code blocks — functions reused.
- [ ]  No hardcoded secrets or unsafe practices.

**UI/UX & Accessibility Checks**

- [ ]  Responsive: test at 320px, 768px, 1024px widths.
- [ ]  Keyboard navigation: can you tab through forms/buttons?
- [ ]  Images/Icons have `alt` text.
- [ ]  Sufficient contrast for text and controls.

**Error Handling & Edge Testing**

- [ ]  Input validation (score ranges, required fields).
- [ ]  Graceful error messages for invalid actions.
- [ ]  Behavior when `localStorage` is full / unsupported.

**Demo Scoring**

- Student gives a 5–10 min demo: trainer ticks functional checklist and asks short Q&A. Use rubric to assign level (1–4) per criterion.

<aside>
🤔

**Peer Testing  →** still not sure whether to implement or not

- Pair students to test another’s app using a short script. Peer feedback included in final assessment.
</aside>

**Final Report**

- Trainer fills a scoring sheet with numeric weights. Provide qualitative feedback + required remediation tasks (if any) with deadlines.

---

## 🛠 Remediation & Resubmission Policy

- If score **<70**, provide a specific corrections list and 2-5 days for resubmission.
- Resubmission re-evaluated with the same rubric; maximum resubmission score capped at 80 unless major new features are added.

### **📦 Deliverables**

- Fully working **JavaScript SaaS application** (EduTrack).
