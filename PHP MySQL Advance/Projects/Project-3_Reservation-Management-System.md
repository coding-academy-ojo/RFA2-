# Project 3 | Reservation Management System

### Project Overview

The Reservation Management System is a web-based application that allows users to book reservations for services such as hotels, restaurants, or event venues. It enables customers to search for availability, make bookings, and manage their reservations, while administrators can oversee bookings, manage availability, and generate reports.

### Project Duration

- Reserve and confirm bookings.
- Manage reservations through a user dashboard.
    
    Administrators should be able to:
    
- Manage services, availability, and bookings.
- View analytics such as number of reservations, revenue, and occupancy rate.

### Core Features

- Responsive design using Bootstrap.
- Landing page with:
    - Navbar with Login/Register.
    - Featured services slider.
    - Search availability section.

### Implementation Phases
