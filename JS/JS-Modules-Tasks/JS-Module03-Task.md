# ðŸŸ¦ Module 03: Loops

## ðŸŽ¯ Task: Multiplication Table Generator (Console App)

Generate a multiplication table for a given number up to 12.

---

## âœ… Requirements

- Prompt the user for a number.
- Use a **for loop** to generate the multiplication table.
- Use a **while loop** to allow repeating until the user chooses to exit.
- Store each result inside an array of objects (`{ multiplier, product }`).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Example Behavior

```js
Enter a number: 5

Table of 5:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
...
5 x 12 = 60

Do you want another table? (y/n): y
```

```

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

- Writing for and while loops.
- Generating repeated output.
- Storing results in arrays of objects
```
