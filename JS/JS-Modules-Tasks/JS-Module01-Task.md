## ðŸŽ¯ Task: Basic Calculator with History (Console App)

Build a calculator that accepts two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Display results in the console and keep track of all calculations in an array.

---

## âœ… Requirements

- Create **functions** for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- Accept user inputs (numbers and operator).
- Handle invalid operators gracefully.
- Store each result as an object in a **history array**.
- Print the full history at the end of the program.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Example Behavior

```js
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5

Result: 50

History:
1. 10 * 5 = 50
```

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

- Declaring variables.
- Writing reusable functions.
- Using operators.
- Working with arrays to store multiple results.
