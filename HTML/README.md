# 🧩 HTML Modules Tasks

### 🎯 Task Description
You’ll be given a reference image (a simple web page). Your mission is to write HTML code that reproduces the layout and content to look the same as the image. Focus on structure, hierarchy, and semantic tags. 🧠💻

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice choosing the right HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, etc.).
- Build a clean, semantic document structure.
- Understand how inline vs block elements affect layout.

---

## 📦 What You’ll Get
A PNG/JPG mockup image of a simple page (hero title, subtitle, paragraph, image/logo, button-like link, simple list, and a footer line). 🖼️

---

## 🛠️ What You Should Do

1. Analyze the image: identify sections (header, main, footer). 🔍  
2. Build the skeleton using proper tags:
   - Use `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` (use backticks so tags show correctly).
3. Use semantic elements where appropriate:
   - `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>` (showed as inline code).
4. Add content with the correct tags:
   - Headings: `h1`–`h3` (use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`)
   - Text: `<p>`
   - Links/Buttons: `<a>` (styled as a button later in CSS; for now use a link)
   - Lists: `<ul>` / `<ol>` + `<li>`
5. Keep your HTML valid, clean, and readable (indentation matters!). ✨

> Optional: At the top of your `replica.html` file add a short comment explaining which tags you chose and why.

## 📤 Submission
- **File name:** `replica.html`  
- Include any images you used (or use a placeholder URL).  
- Optional: add a short comment at the top explaining which tags you chose and why. 💬

---

## 🧪 Evaluation (Rubric)
- **Semantic Structure (40%)** – Appropriate use of headings, sections, lists, and links.  
- **Accuracy (30%)** – Content order and hierarchy resemble the image.  
- **Accessibility (15%)** – Proper `alt` text, meaningful link text, logical heading order.  
- **Code Quality (15%)** – Clean indentation, valid HTML, helpful comments.

---

## 💡 Tips & Hints
- Use heading levels to match visual importance from the image.  
- Buttons in the image? Use an `<a>` for now (we’ll style it later). 🔘  
- If you see grouped content, consider `<section>` or `<article>`.  
- Remember: block elements stack; inline elements flow within a line. 📚
